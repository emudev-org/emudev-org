<p class="lead"><b>emudev.org</b> is a network of people interested in the documentation, emulation, simulation and re-implementation of hardware near extinction.</p>

The purpose of this organization is the preservation of platforms that have been designed or used for gaming and other artistic endeavors. Think of it as an attempt to tackle the hardware side of [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware).

The primary goals are:
* Collection, integration/unification and publication of previously hardware documentation in a standardized format as well as further improvement of such material via reverse engineering and testing.
* Publication of "proof" of said documentation in the form of tests that clearly replicate the documented behavior, in a standardized format designed for easy 3rd party replication of results.
* Development of validation suites designed for validation of software and hardware implementations based on available tests featuring multiple "conformance levels".
* Development of software that provides a reference implementation of said hardware.
* Development of hardware and software cores that implement said hardware.
* Development of compatible replacements for firmware/bios of said hardware, including documentation, tests and validation suites.
* Make all information, source code and designs available for no cost and liberal licenses (MIT-style).

This effort is not related to piracy. You will not find binaries/roms here.

## Where Do I Start?

There are many ways to contribute to emudev, whatever your background or skill level.
* Our [Getting Started](/getting_started) page is written for beginners, and includes resources for learning general emulation techniques and terminology.
* If you're interested in working on a particular system, our [System Resources](/system_resources) page consolidates reliable hardware research on many popular systems from around the web.
* If you don't know where to find the information you need, or you just want to talk with other developers, consider joining our [Discord chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/dkmJAes) or other [emulation-related Discord servers](/discord_related).
