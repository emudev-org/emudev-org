# emudev.org
> Emulator development for education and preservation

This is the emudev.org website, built with jekyll on github pages. To add a resource to one of our lists, edit `getting_started.md` or `system_resources.md`. To contribute a blog post, add an appropriately named and formatted markdown file to the `_posts` directory. To modify the styling, edit `_layouts/default.html`. This website is very bare bones at the moment, and contributions of any kind are appreciated.
